{{< alert color="warning" title="Caution" >}}
The project is under active development and it is not suggested to build an Index unless you want to participate in the development efforts. When preparing to build, please make sure you do your research and are involved in the project via Discord and GitHub.
{{< /alert >}}

## What is the Index?

The Index is an open source Pick and Place (PnP) project led by Stephen Hawes. The Index is designed to be low cost and suited towards [mid-scale manufacturing](http://stephenhawes.com/level-2-manufacturing/).

## What does it do?

The Index is capable of placing parts as small as 0402. It is currently set up to use strip feeders, but development around active, powered feeders is ongoing.

It is completely open source and hackable. The main controller has three AUX ports, allowing anyone to add on peripherals or communicate with other machines.

## Summary

This section is all about plugging stuff in! This is where we'll route and plug in all the cables, along with all the pneumatic tubing. We'll also be making a couple umbilical harnesses, so break out that heat gun!

{{< alert color="info" title="Note" >}}
Every cable harness has a single label at one end. **The end of the cable with the label is the one that plugs into the motherboard**. We'll start by plugging the unlabeled end into the motor/actuator and routing them back to the motherboard. Then it's easy to just match the label on the cable with the silkscreen on the board.

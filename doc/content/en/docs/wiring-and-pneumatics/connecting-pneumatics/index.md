Now that we've got everything wired up, it's time to get all the tubing plumbed. 

## Plumbing the staging plate
The origin of vacuum in the machine is our vacuum pump. The off-center port is the one that provides vacuum. Start by pushing on the ____ stretch of 6mm OD tubing onto the off-center port on the vacuum pump. Push the other end onto the ______ port of the valve.

Now, take the _____ stretch of 6mm OD tubing and push it onto the ____ port of the valve, and push the other side into the single, larger port of the Y splitter.

Now we'll switch to using 4mm OD tubing. Take the ______ length of 4mm OD tubing and push one side into a fork of the Y splitter, and route the other end underneath the motherboard and onto the VAC1 sensor port.

{{< alert color="info" title="Keep In Mind" >}}
This sensor is only attached to the motherboard with six solder joints. Be gentle when pushing the tubing onto it. Twisting the tubing back and forth as you push it down can help get it on without too much force.

## Plumbing the X gantry

Now we'll take the long, ______ length of 4mm OD tubing and push it into the other fork of the Y splitter. Take the loose end, and route it underneath the motherboard, then up through all the zip ties that are holding the X umbilical in place, including those along the swivel arm.

Now that the pneumatics are also routed, we can finally tighten the zip ties on the umbilical cable guide. While your Index is still back on its haunches, tighten the zip tie on the ______ part to secure the wires and tubing to the frame.

Bring your Index down onto its four legs, and tighten the zip ties, ensuring to keep a bit of slack between the bottom securing print and this one. You can move up the umbilical swivel and tighten all the zip ties along the whole thing.

With the pneumatic tubing dangling loose past the end of the swivel arm, push the other end into the pneumatic coupling on the back side of the rotation stepper motor. All this extra slack will allow the motor to rotate freely 180 degrees in each direction.

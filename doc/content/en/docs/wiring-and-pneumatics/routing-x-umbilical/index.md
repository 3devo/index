  Connecting and securing the X gantry umbilical cable
---

For this, all you'll need is your freshly made X gantry umbilical cable, and TODO(ziptie num) zip ties.

## Securing to the X gantry

To begin, we'll plug in all five cables that come to the X gantry. First, plug in the four terminal connector with only three wires into the limit switch on the right side of the X gantry. Plug in the six terminal JST XH connector with only four wires into the Z gantry stepper motor in the center of the X gantry. Next, plug in the three terminal JST XH connector into the down ring light, and the small four terminal JST connector into the down camera. Lastly, plug the last remaining cable (four terminal connector with four wires, not JST XH) into the left gantry rotation stepper motor.

Now, we need to zip tie the harness to the cable guide on the X gantry. Align the harness as shown in the picture below, and secure the cable to the guide (FDM-????) with ??? zip ties.

## Securing to the frame

Now we need to secure the other end of the umbilical to the frame of the machine, on the front left leg. Move the Y gantry all the way to the back of the machine until you feel it hit the limit of travel, and do the same with the X gantry to the right of the machine. This will ensure that you don't fasten the cable too tightly such that it restricts the machine's motion.

Now, take the umbilical and guide it along the umbilical swivel prints that originate from the. Take four zip ties and **loosely** secure them through the zip tie guides on the two swivel prints and around the umbilical. Do not tighten yet, as we still need to route the pneumatic tubing through these zip ties.

Now route the X gantry umbilical through the two loose zip ties you attached around the left leg umbilical guide in the last step. Don't tighten these yet; we still need to route the pneumatics.

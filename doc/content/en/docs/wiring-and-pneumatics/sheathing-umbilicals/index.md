  Creating the two umbilical cables in the machine 
---

Now we'll assemble the two umbilical cables in the machine. The one connecting from the front left leg to the left side of the Y gantry is the Y gantry umbilical, and the one connecting from the front left leg to the X gantry is the X gantry umbilical.

## Y Gantry Umbilical

This cable bundle will contain the following:
* X axis limit switch cable (CHA-0007)
* X axis motor cable (CHA-0003)
* Two pieces of heatshrink tubing
* 825mm of sheathing (shorter of the two)

### Laying out the cables

To begin, we'll get these two cables laid out at the correct spacing. Having these spaced correctly ensures that every cable reaches every plug with strain relief and length for movement. Place the TODO: insert correct length information

XL and XM should be perfectly aligned on the label side, no offset.
Push sheathing all the way up to where the black wire enclosure ends for the XM harness

### Sheathing the cables

Now, take the piece of TODO(sheathing length) sheathing and expand it by compressing it. You should find that inserting the two cables at the correct offset will maintain this offset while pushing the sheathing over them. Follow the pictures below for a good method of pushing the cables through the sheathing

### Heatshrink

With the sheathing an equal distance from the closest connector on each side, slide two pieces of heatshrink tubing over the fraying end of the sheathing, with equal parts on the cables and on the sheathing. This is to hold the sheathing in place, keep it from fraying, and generally making it look nicer. Use a heat gun or lighter to heat the heatshrink tight onto the cable.

## X Gantry Umbilical

This cable bundle will contain the following:
* Z axis limit switch cable (CHA-0008)(Labeled ``)
* Z axis motor cable (CHA-0004)
* Left rotation motor cable (CHA-0005)
* Down light cable (CHA-0009)
* Down camera USB cable (inside camera box, the longer of the two)

### Laying out the cables

To begin, we'll get these five cables laid out at the correct spacing. Having these spaced correctly ensures that every cable reaches every plug with strain relief and length for movement. Place the TODO: insert correct length information

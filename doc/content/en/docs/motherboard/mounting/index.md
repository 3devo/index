     Instructions about how to mount the motherboard on the staging plate
---

Now that we've got all the THT components soldered in, it's time to mount the motherboard to the staging plate.

It's important to make sure we're mounting the motherboard in the correct place on the staging plate so that all the cables fit and reach their respective ports correctly. Put your Lumen up on its haunches and take a look at the left side of the staging plate. Reference the picture below for which holes you should mount the 25mm standoffs. Pass four M3 x 8mm screws through the top side of the staging plate, and tighten them into the standoffs.

Now we can mount the motherboard itself. Take the board, and ensuring that the USB ports are facing to the left, and the vacuum sensors on the bottom, thread another four M3 x 8mm screws through the mounting holes on the motherboard into the standoffs.

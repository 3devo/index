## Stepper Motor Driver Headers
The last connectors that need to be soldered into the board are the 1x8 Dupont 0.1" headers for the stepper motor drivers. Two connectors need to be soldered for each driver. We recommend soldering a single pin in place first while getting the connector to stay flat, then do the rest of the pins after the orientation is solidified. Orientation does not matter for these connectors.

  Assembling the Y Gantry
---

Oh boy, we're flyin' now! It's time to get going on the Y gantry. This is what moves the toolhead forward and back, and also carries the X gantry as well. We've got a few sub-assemblies in this one, so let's dive in!

## X Idler Sub-Assembly

## X Motor Mount Sub-Assembly

### Necessary Components & Tools

Collect the necessary items to complete the X motor mount. These are:

* 1x X Motor Mount ([FDM-0006-00_x-motor-mount]({{< relref "/docs/printing-the-parts/fdm#fdm_0006_00_x_motor_mount" >}}))
* 1x NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
* 1x GT2 Drive Pulley (5mm Bore, 20 teeth, 6mm belt width)
* 4x M3x12mm Machine Screw
* 2 mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver
* 2.5mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver

{{< container-image path="images/67e988e25ac5b706.png" alt="" >}}

### Assembly

1. Install the GT2 pulley onto the motor shaft. The set screw side of the pulley should be nearest the motor. Tighten the set screws to lock the pulley into place. It should be at the tip of the shaft.

### Assembly

1. Insert a M5 Hex Nut into one of the hex nut locations on the Y gantry body and push into the 3d print.

2. Pull the hex nut fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into it from the opposite side of the Y gantry body. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for the remaining seven M5 nut locations.
4. Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the Y Gantry Body.

5. Tighten an M3 x 16mm screw into the Hex Nut installed in the previous step.
6. Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the Y Gantry Support.

7. Tighten an M3 x 16mm screw into the Hex Nut installed in the previous step.
8. Insert a M5x40mm machine screw into the Y Gantry Body through each of the two positions for the top rollers.

9. Place a V-Slot roller onto the two M5x40mm machine screws.

10. Insert M5 Hex Nuts into back side of Y Gantry Support and then place the Y gantry support onto the two M5x40mm machine screws.

{{< container-image path="images/714f9529b4e71eb9.png" alt="" >}}

11. Repeat steps 1-10 for the second Y gantry body & support

## Final Assembly

13. Place a gantry body assembly (steps 1-10 x 2) on each end of a v-slot extrusion. Don't worry about pushing it all the way into the print; there's extra space for adjustment.

15. Drop in and position a nut under the machine screw hole on the top of each gantry side and **loosely thread** a M5x10mm machine screw into each of the nuts. We do not want to tighten these yet; there is still adjusting to do.

21. Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X idler assembly to the right side gantry body. Note that this part does have a polarity: the head of the machine screw that holds the idler should be visible when looking down at the top of the machine.

22. Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X motor mount & gantry umbilical mount to the left side gantry body. The motor should be on top with the pulley facing downwards. The umbilical mount should be at the back, on the same side as the wires.

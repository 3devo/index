## Necessary Components & Tools

{{< container-image path="images/required_parts.png" alt="Necessary Parts and Tools for Left Side Assembly" >}}

## Belt Tension Arm

{{< container-image path="images/IMG_20210826_150501-web.jpg" alt="Belt Tension Arm Parts" >}}

1. Insert an M3 Hex Nut into the back of the Belt Tension Arm.

2. Insert the M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the Belt Tension Arm and then tighten.
3. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.

4. Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the Belt Tension Arm so that it passes through the GT2 Pulley Idler.
5. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten.

6. Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the slot for the hex nut on the bottom of the Idler Mount on the leg.
7. Insert completed Belt Tension Arm assembly into belt tensioning slot on Leg.
8. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut.

## Assembly

9. Take the Left Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted.

10. Take the Left Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Left Back Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.

11. On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

12. On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

13. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

14. Now, mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the back left leg. Attach it using four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.

15. Mount one of the three limit switches to the front left leg as shown in the image. Use two M3x8mm screws and tap them directly into the print.

16. Next, we'll mount the frame umbilical guide. Using two M5x25mm screws, mount FDM-???? onto the front left leg as shown, threading directly into the part.

17. Lastly, we'll assemble the umbilical swivel. This part helps keep the X gantry umbilical suspended over the build area. The two parts fit together as shown below, and are secured in place with a M5 x 40mm bolt and an M5 nut. Tighten so there's no play in the fit, but the two parts can swivel easily. Set it aside for now.

## Assembly

9. Take the Right Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted (See Left Side Assembly Step 1 for an example).

10. Take the Right Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Right Back Leg.

11. On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

12. On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

13. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

  The Left and Right side assemblies that were completed in the previous steps are next connected together by two 600mm v-slot extrusions.  
---

One is installed near the front, while the second is installed adjacent to the back legs.

## Necessary Components & Tools

Collect the necessary items to complete the main frame. These are:

* 1x [Left Side]({{< relref "/docs/mechanical-assembly/left-side" >}}) Assembly
* 1x [Right Side]({{< relref "/docs/mechanical-assembly/right-side" >}}) Assembly
* 1x Body Umbilical Guide ([FDM-0022-00_umbilical-guide]({{< relref "/docs/printing-the-parts/fdm#fdm_0022_00_umbilical_guide" >}}))
* 1x Staging Plate
* 2x 20mm x 20mm Aluminum V-Slot - 600mm
* 4x M5x10mm Machine Screw
* 12x M5x8mm Machine Screw
* 16x M5 Slot Nuts
* 6x 2020 Corner Bracket
* 3mm Allen Key or Hex Screwdriver

## Assembly

3. Insert a new v-slot extrusion (in green below) into the left front leg underneath the bottom rail.

3. Drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole and use a M5x10mm machine screw to fasten the v-slot extrusion to the left leg.

6. Drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole and use a M5x10mm machine screw to fasten the v-slot extrusion to the right leg.

7. Attach a 2020 corner bracket to the 20x20 V-Slot on the left side using two drop-in nuts and two M5x8mm screws.

10. Attach a 2020 corner bracket to the 20x20 V-Slot on the right side using two drop-in nuts and two M5x8mm screws.

15. Position the umbilical guide on the bottom side of the bottom rail of the left side.

16. Fasten the umbilical guide in place using two M5x10mm screws and two drop-in nuts.

18. Affix a 2020 corner bracket to the end of another V-slot using the a drop-in nut and an M5x8mm screw. Make sure the side of the bracket is perfectly flush with the end of the extrusion. It helps to tighten it in place against a flat surface.

19. Repeat the previous step three times to install three more braces in the orientation shown below. This is the back rail.

22. Flip the machine upside down. Using four M5x8mm screws and four drop-in nuts, fasten the back rail to the left and right sides of the machine as shown below. Make sure that the ends of the back rail are perfectly flush with the sides of the extrusion on the left and right sides. This will help keep the machine square.

26. Place the staging plate onto the frame. Ensure the front edge of the staging plate is exactly ???? mm from the front legs as shown below.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
The frame needs to be square for the gantry to work properly. When the Y gantry is installed, you might want to adjust the 
plate and back cross-piece to ensure that the frame is square. We'll walk you through this when we get to it, though!

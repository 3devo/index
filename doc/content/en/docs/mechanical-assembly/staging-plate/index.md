The staging plate is a part which can be sourced locally or via the [Index Machines Shop](https://shop.indexmachines.io/). 

If you choose to build your own staging plate, please refer to the [CSM-0001_staging-plate.FCStd](https://github.com/index-machines/index/blob/master/pnp/cad/CSM/CSM-0001_staging-plate.FCStd) file. 

The plate is assumed to be 3mm thick steel in the standard index design. While it is possible to build the plate out of 
materials such as plastic or wood, the thickness of these materials will need to be adjusted to ensure the staging plate 
does not sag or flex.

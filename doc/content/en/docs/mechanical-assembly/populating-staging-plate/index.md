  Mounting components to the staging plate 
---

We now have the main structure of the machine assembled! Now we'll mount some components to the bottom of the staging plate.

## Necessary Components

* components

## Pump mount

The first thing we'll mount to the staging plate is the pump mount. This print suspends the pump using a couple rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.

Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the recesses in FDM-????

Now we'll mount the pump in the print using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.

Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the mount. Now guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it's suspended in the print.

Mount it to the staging plate using four M3 x 8mm screws in the location shown below.

## Valve mount
Now we'll attach the valve mount to the staging plate. Press fit M3 nuts into the recesses in FDM-????

Now we'll mount the valve to the print. Use ??????? hardware to bolt the valve to the mount as shown below

## Pneumatic Y splitter mount
This one is easy! We'll just mount the pneumatic Y splitter to the staging plate using an M3 x ?mm bolt and an M3 nut. You can find the correct location and orientation to mount it below:

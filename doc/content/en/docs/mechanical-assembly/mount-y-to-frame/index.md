  In this step you will assemble the tools you desire for your Index build.

At the moment we support two sets of tools: A Placement Head and a Paste Dispensing Head (coming soon).

## Necessary Components

* Placement Head:
* 1x NEMA11 Motor
* 4x M2.5x8mm Screws
* 1x Pneumatic Fitting (6mm OD Tube and M5 Thread)
* 1x CP40 Nozzle Holder

## Assembly

1. Place the entire structure on top of the top rails of the frame

2. On both sides, below the rail, insert a v-slot roller with a roller spacer on each side. Then push a M5x40mm machine screw through the gantry and roller assembly.

3. Now roll the Y gantry to the very front of the machine. Adjust the fit of the Y gantry extrusion inside the roller assemblies you just made such that the top rollers fit perfectly into the v-slot. After you budge them in or out to make the top rollers sit perfect, tighten the top bolts you only loosely threaded a few steps ago. This is locking in the Y gantry extrusion spacing.

4. Now we need to make sure this spacing doesn't just work for the front of the machine, but for the entire length of it as well. Loosen the machine screws holding in the staging plate, and the ones connecting the back rail to the left and right side. While applying light pressure down on the Y gantry, roll it to the back of the machine. You might find that you need to expand or contract the back legs to have the rollers ride perfectly in the v-slot. Once you have the correct spacing, tighten the bolts on the staging plate and the ones mounting the back rail. This locks in the Y gantry extrusion spacing for the back of the machine as well.

5. Wahoo! You're all parallel! Now we can tighten the rollers on the Y gantry. Adjust the bottom rollers up so they snug against the extrusion and ensure that the v-slot rollers run well in the slots. This adjustment should be done with the M3x16mm screws in the bottom of the Y Gantry Body and Y Gantry Support. You want to make sure that there's no play or wiggle in the fit, but don't overtighten to the point of increasing resistance to rolling. The gantry should move easily, but not loosely.

  Mounting datum board and setting camera exposure
---

Now we need to set the exposure for both cameras. Setting this defines our vision pipelines down the road, so it's important to set these early on and set them well.

1. The datum board you used for fisheye calibration can now be mounted to the staging plate! We're going to be using it for setting the top camera exposure. Using the datum board, four M3x16mm screws, four M3 nuts, and one datum board mount (FDM-0055), mount the datum board on the staging plate as shown in the image below, with the fisheye calibration pattern facing down. You should see a gold grid of lines and a fiducial in the center of the Index logo facing upwards. Tighten this down very well; this will define the center point for the entire machine

# Index PnP Assembly Guide

[Codelab Feedback](https://github.com/sphawes/index/issues)


## Introduction



**Last Updated:** 2021-01-08

### **What is Index?**

Index is an open source Pick and Place machine being developed by Stephen Hawes. The Index is designed to be low cost and be controlled by  [OpenPNP](https://openpnp.org/). 

### **What you'll build**

This tutorial will take you through the build of the Index Pick and Place machine from parts to an assembled frame with the electronics installed. It will cover feeder floor installation, but will not cover the build of the feeders.

Your final Index will be ready for connection to OpenPNP. It will look similar to the following:

TODO: Insert Some Pictures of Index

### **What you'll learn**

* How to prepare and assemble the frame and gantries of the Index
* How to assemble the motion system of the Index
* How to connect and install the electronic components of the Index
* How to connect Index to OpenPNP

This guide is focused on assembling an Index and getting to being able to run your first job. Certain configuration details may be glossed over and simply provided to copy and paste.

### **What you'll need**

#### **Parts**

> aside negative
> 
> **Caution:** The project is under active development and not all materials will be in sync. Please ensure that you've done some research to ensure you select the appropriate model, BOM, hardware, firmware and software combination.

To build your own index you will need to acquire the items listed on the  [BOM](https://github.com/sphawes/index/blob/freecad/pnp/bom.csv). This includes various mechanical components along with a significant number of  [3D printed parts](https://github.com/sphawes/index/tree/cba9cf411a3931a325bd251ce826df69dbc16522/pnp/cad/3D-Prints). When printing the 3d parts, be sure to print them with the recommended settings.

#### **Tools**

The following tools are needed to build the Index.

* 2mm Allen Key
* 2.5mm Allen Key
* 3mm Allen Key
* 4mm Allen Key
* Fine Tip Tweezers (for positioning T-Nuts)
* Pliers / Vice Grips
* Utility Knife / Precision Blade

#### **Tips & Tricks**

When assembling the Index, the following tips will help the process go more smoothly.

* **Clean up your 3D prints well.** Make sure that you have removed any support material, and have cleaned up the edges of any holes. Test that you can fit the V-Slot or machine screw for a specific part into the hole.
* **Deburr the aluminum profile at the ends.** Then it's easier to put parts together.
* **Positioning Slot Nuts** can be a bit of a challenge. A simple way to get them into the right place is to use gravity to get them close, and then use either the long end an allen key or a pair of fine tipped tweezers to push or pull them to the exact position.
* **Inserting Belts** can be easier if you move the gantry you're inserting the belt into to the middle of the rail it is on and then as you insert the belt, move it away from the side you want the belt to come out from. The v-slot will catch the belt and once you've moved the gantry a little bit, you will be able to catch the belt. Passing a belt through a belt slot from the inner side can be easier if you place an exacto knife blade at the back side of the slot and butt the belt against that while drawing it up through the slot.
* **Press Fit Nuts** are used in several places. If your printer tolerances make it so these nuts don't stay in you can use a piece of tape over the back to hold them in temporarily.


## Left Side
Duration: 10:00


The left side provides the rails on which the Y gantry runs. In addition, most of the cables are routed to the front left of the machine as that is where the controller ultimately lives.

## Flash Motherboard



Duration: 20:00

With the frame complete it is time to configure the software side of things before hooking up the motherboard to the machine. This procedure was designed for Linux but it should work as well for macOS and Windows.

### **Necessary Components**

* Index Frame
* Index Mobo
* USB-A cable

### **Process:**

1. Install VS Code and the Platform IO (PIO) Plugin
2. Clone the Index repository with: `git clone https://github.com/sphawes/index`
3. Open the PIO project in `pnp/code/firmware_marlin`
4. Attach the Index Mobo to your computer with the USB-A cable
5. Boot the STM32 in DFU Mode
    1. Press and hold BOOT0
    2. Press Reset
    3. Release Reset
    4. Now you can release BOOT0

6. Use "Upload" (*arrow to the right* in the bottom left corner) to upload to the board:
<img src="img/f7685fd40b0d9864.png" alt="f7685fd40b0d9864.png"  width="359.00" />

7. Wait for the process to finish:
<img src="img/14a0fb34b7f3144c.png" alt="14a0fb34b7f3144c.png"  width="616.00" />

8. Press Reset on the board. Now it should show up as a COM Port on your PC.

### **Troubleshooting DFU Upload:**

* Make sure, that your board shows up correctly in DFU mode: 
<img src="img/c480dc32c0509b9e.png" alt="c480dc32c0509b9e.png"  width="399.50" />
* Edit the PIO config file (platformio.ini, located in the project folder):

1. Search for "STM32F407VE_black", backup the old config and then replace the existing config with the following
2. Notice that "upload_port           = 0483:df11" is commented out. This setting caused issues, at least for some users. After disabling it, uploading worked.

#### **Things to check if the board doesn't show up as "STM32 BOOTLOADER":**

* Check if the USB hub works by connecting devices to other ports. This is not an absolute guarantee that the connection to the STM32 works though.
* Check if all solder joints look fine
* Check if all voltages are present
* Keep in mind that blank STM32s should still appear as a USB device, even if they have no firmware loaded onto them
* Check the 8MHz crystal oscillator of the SMT32. It's correct operation is important for normal operation of the DFU. Wrong frequency and / or incorrect load capacitors can cause issues.

#### **Alternative method to upload:**

This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent). Additionally you need the software  [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) by ST. This method is a bit more involved and takes longer than just using the DFU mode. 

1. Compile (build) the project normally with PIO

1. This generates a .bin-file that contains the firmware
2. Connect your board to your ST-Link through the SWD header on board
3. Start STM32CubeProgrammer
4. Connect to the MCU:
<img src="img/3a1798928d41bb18.png" alt="3a1798928d41bb18.png"  width="306.00" />

5. Click on **Open file** and navigate to the **firmware.bin** file in *PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.pio/build/STM32F407VE_black*
<img src="img/efe1d5f076b9be61.png" alt="efe1d5f076b9be61.png"  width="375.00" />

6. Click on **Download**. This will flash the SMT32F4 with the provided firmware
<img src="img/767cc275e3916de2.png" alt="767cc275e3916de2.png"  width="594.80" />

7. Done! Now you just have to disconnect the ST-Link and press Reset on the board <img src="img/3948425b05249e54.png" alt="3948425b05249e54.png"  width="535.11" />
